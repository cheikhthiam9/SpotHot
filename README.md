For how firebase is incorporated see Gustavo. For now though, use mock data

structure
/components - add custom components here that can be resued by multiple screens
/models - this is classes that are related to firebase backend
/screens - all different screen
to test your screen, add its navigation to main.dart and nav.push in code
